Relevant degree
I have a range of academic qualifications that are relevant to this role and compliment my professional experience. I have a BA(hons) in Politics from Lancaster University, a PGCE in Primary Education from Wolverhampton University, and a MA in Education Policy from University College London, which is rated as the number one university in the world for education studies. 

Experience of working with disaffected / vulnerable young people.
I have considerable experience of working with disaffected and vulnerable young people. Prior to becoming a qualified teacher, I was a project worker at a supported housing unit for homeless 16-24 year olds. The supported housing unit was situated within a deprived area, and my role focussed on supporting the residents into education, training, or employment in addition to helping them become more independent. I enjoyed working with the young people I supported to understand the complexities that they faced in their everyday lives, and working with other agencies such as schools, colleges, or employers to overcome the barriers that they struggled with. I took an honest, compassionate, and user-centred approach to ensure that those I was supporting were claiming the correct benefits, able to access appropriate training, and able to secure suitable employment.
In addition to this, I also have experience of working as a teacher in a challenging inner-London primary school where many pupils faced extensive barriers to learning including: homelessness, domestic abuse, learning disabilities, and learning to speak English as an additional language. As a result, many children displayed behavioural difficulties and it took time to build trust and understanding so that I could consider how best to help them during their time at school. I relished the challenge of creating a safe, stimulating environment in school which my pupils could develop and learn despite whatever was happening outside of school. However, I also strove to work with other teachers, families, and the local authority to help pupils in their wider lives outside of the classroom. 

Experience of leading a team		
I have experience of leading small teams, and as a class teacher I lead teaching assistants, student teachers, junior teachers, and of course many pupils. 
While working in London and teaching a particularly challenging class, where four students had statements of educational need and a further five pupils were on the school’s special educational needs register, I lead a team of four teaching assistants and a student teacher. Even with such a large teaching team the class remained challenging, so I ensured that my team worked as effectively as possible. I achieved this by clearly modelling my expectations; always remaining calm and focussed on the task at hand. I also listened closely to what all members of staff had to say and acted quickly on their concerns, for example calling parents whenever there were worries about the welfare of a child. Additionally, I also worked hard to ensure that staff moral remained high by celebrating the good work that the team was doing and pointing out all of the great progress our pupils were making.
By the end of the year we were a tight knit team who had helped all members of our class make good academic and personal progress, despite the challenges we had faced along the way.

Specialist skills and experience (eg supporting young people with substance misuse/ mental health /Autistic Spectrum Disorders) 	
I have experience of working with young people with substance misuse problems, mental health problems, and those on the Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
I have substantial experience of working with young people with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. I have taught many pupils diagnosed with ASD in a mainstream educational setting and have helped them overcome challenges associated with their condition. For example, I have experience of helping a child transition from mainstream to special education. The process began by supporting the child’s parents and advising them around the appropriateness of specialist education for their son, and discussing school options. Following the decision to transfer to a special school, I worked with the new school, for example by arranging transfer days, where the boy visited his new school and became comfortable in the new setting. In addition to this, I also have experience of teaching autistic children in special school settings, for example at Ysgol Y Gogarth in Llandudno.
I also have experience of supporting people with mental health problems. For example, working as a teacher one of my pupils was suffering from mental health issues following the death of his mother. To help him I spoke to his father and suggested a referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAHMS). While the father was initially reluctant to go ahead with the referral due to community stigma surrounding mental health issues, due to the positive relationship I had developed with him and his son, he eventually agreed, and his son was able to access the help he needed. I applied a similar approach, when working as a project worker – where many of the young homeless people I supported had substance misuse issues - I supported them by working with them to build trust and understanding before directing them to appropriate local support groups and resources and taking a proactive approach to ensuring they were able to access these resources. 

Experience of working in partnership with other agencies and contributing to professionals’ meetings and multidisciplinary panels
I have experience of making positive contributions to professional multidisciplinary panels, and understand the importance of applying a whole-system approach to support service users.
As a teacher I regularly attended the annual reviews of children with statemented special educational needs. Reviews would be attended by a range of other professionals and interested parties from different organisations - such as social workers, educational psychologists, parents, other teachers, or speech and language therapists. An example of a time I made a positive contribution to such a meeting was when, as the teacher of a seven year old autistic child, I worked alongside an educational psychologist and other professionals to develop a plan to explain to the child that she was autistic, and what autism was. My contributions, such as identifying language and concepts that the child would be able to understand, and my willingness to engage with other partners so that I could benefit from their expertise, facilitated the successful development and implementation of the plan. Over a period of several months, I was able to implement the plan and help the child understand what autism meant to them. 

Working knowledge of the Children’s Act 1989/2004 and the Social Care and Wellbeing Act 2014 and other relevant Education Acts relating to Attendance and Inclusion
I have good knowledge of a range of education policy as a result of completing an MA in Education Policy; as part of my course I studied a range of policies and their implications for practice.
Further to my academic understanding, I have received extensive child protection training, for example regarding the Children’s Act’s (2004) requirement for close interdisciplinary cooperation. I note the importance of the Social Care and Wellbeing Act (Wales) (2014)’s provision that education is an important part of a person’s wellbeing. Additionally, I have experience of helping parents fulfil their requirement to ensure their children receive a suitable education under the 1996 Education Act, for example by helping arrange appropriate transport to and from school. 
I also feel that acts such as the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 and the 2010 Equality Act, will be vitally important to this role. I understand the importance of ensuring that those with protected characteristics are able to access high-quality education, and strive to consider the impact of my decisions in the context of Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act. 

Experience of working on European Projects and the requirements of detailed record keeping
I have experience of working on European Projects and understand the need to record appropriate data. For example, while working as a teacher in London, my school received an EU grant designed to improve foreign language provision. As part of the project we were required to keep detailed assessment data around our pupils’ attainment in French. I recorded the data accurately and reliably in order to ensure accountability; in addition to ensuring that detailed records were kept for the purpose of the funding, I enjoyed evaluating the data at the end of the project as it showed how much progress the children had made and demonstrated that we had made good use of the funding.

A good level of digital literacy		
I have an extremely high level of digital literacy, and this is something that I have developed professionally and in my spare time. I am confident using Microsoft Packages such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint to communicate and display information, and in my spare time I have developed smartphone apps and websites.
I enjoy all manner of computing projects and have often found ways to utilise my skills within the workplace. Colleagues often ask for my support with IT issues and I am always more than happy to help, for example, I recently worked at Ysgol Eirias and was asked to troubleshoot an issue with a projector – I was able to diagnose the problem and change the bulb within minutes to ensure the lesson could continue. 

Good communication skills both written and verbal across a wide range of audiences	
I have excellent communication skills both verbally and in writing. I have written documents for a broad range of audiences, from essays to be read by academic professors, to stories to be read by five year old children who speak English as an additional language. Verbally I have presented to rooms of education professionals with confidence, but also led assemblies to young Key Stage 1 children. In line with these experiences, I have learnt about importance of targeting language and content to your audience and adapting language choices based on context and those that you are speaking to. 

The ability to communicate in English is essential.	
I am a native speaker and have a high standard of written and verbal English.

The ability to communicate in Welsh is desirable.	
As a teacher in Wales I use Welsh every day. I enjoy using the language in the classroom, for example by asking questions or giving instructions in Welsh.

Ability to create and maintain a high standard of quality and performance throughout the team.
I have experience of leading teams which maintain a high standard of quality and performance. I know that the most important way to ensure high quality of performance is to model good practice, team members will look to the way you handle situations for guidance. I also am aware that any lower performance should be challenged and support put in place as soon as possible.
One of my proudest achievements as a teacher was coaching and training a student teacher who was placed for a term in my class. While the student teacher was working in the class it became apparent that she needed to develop her behaviour management skills so that she could improve her teaching practice.
In order to help with this I modelled some behaviour management techniques which I knew to be particularly successful and taught alongside her as she practiced the new techniques. In addition to this I also modelled how I searched for new teaching techniques when I encountered a problem in my own practice. By directing her towards a number of books I found useful, I gave her a long-term strategy to help her improve when she was no longer my student. 
As a result of my actions, and her own hard work, the behaviour management issues were corrected and the student is now a successful primary teacher in her own right.

Ability to manage a diverse team of staff and support teams/individuals through change processes
I have lead highly diverse teams that have included people from a broad range of ethnic, religious, and socio-economic backgrounds and have always valued the variety of worldviews and life experiences that diversity brings. 
I also have experience of supporting teams through change processes. For example when I worked at a school that moved from a traditional style of teaching maths to one which used a ‘Singapore style’ which heavily promoted the use of physical resources, such as counting beads and Cuisenaire rods. Initially some of the members of my teaching team were unsure of how to use the resources and were resistant to change. However, I modelled the use of the resources, offered to help anyone who was unsure, and took the time to explain the value of the objects. Over time, my approach ensured that the use of the new resources became integrated in to the practice of the whole team as all individual members became comfortable with the changes.

Over time, my approach ensured that the use of the new resources became integrated in to the practice of the whole team as all individual members became comfortable with the changes.

Ability to monitor the effectiveness of the team.
I have experience of monitoring team effectiveness both quantitatively, through examining data, and qualitatively, through observing practice. I believe the most important part of any monitoring is to use the data proactively to identify training or experience gaps and provide meaningful opportunities for team members to improve their practice.

Experience of and ability to deliver formal and informal supervision
I have experience of both formal and informal supervision. Formally, I have acted as the mentor to a student teacher who was placed by her university in my school. This involved working with the student to ensure she met and evidenced all of the teaching standards during her placement so she could be awarded Qualified Teacher Status. This involved me conducting formal observations and recording strengths and areas for development as well as reporting on her progress to her university tutor. I enjoyed helping provide opportunities for her to develop her practice, for example helping her arrange to observe other teachers who I knew to be excellent practitioners, or working with her to develop her teaching plans and resources. The student teacher’s placement was highly successful and she became an excellent teacher in her own right. More informally, I have coached and supported a number of newly qualified teachers and enjoy the chance to share good practice.

Ability to chair team meetings effectively
I have experience of chairing meetings, for example ‘phase’ planning meetings in schools. In my experience the role of the chair is to balance the needs of individuals to have their concerns heard and recognised, with the need to stick to an agreed agenda and schedule. It is important that the chair calmly and politely manages the agenda. 

Awareness of HR policies and procedures and ability to implement positively to manage staffing issues
Establishing confident teams was an important part of my job as a class teacher. I found that the best way to ensure this was constant communication between all members of the team so that if anyone was not confident or unsure about any aspect of their work this could be immediately addressed; either through general discussion, formal training, or informal coaching or mentoring. 
One such example was when I noticed that a teaching assistant I was working with was not using a technique called ‘reciprocal communication’ with the autistic child she worked with. The technique had been recommended by an SEN consultant and was very important to developing the child’s language. I spoke to the TA informally and asked why she was not using the technique. As a result of our strong relationship and the non-confrontational approach I had used, she was able to tell me that she did not feel confident with the technique. Following the initial discussion, I emailed the consultant and arranged for her to remodel the technique to the TA the next time she was in school. Following this, the TA felt more confident using the technique and was highly motivated to deploy it competently. Thanks to the techniques used and the developing relationship between the TA and the student, the language of the child she was working with developed greatly over the course of the year.

Ability to organise time and set priorities for this role and for team members
I have highly developed time management and prioritisation skills. An example of this is from when between 2015 and 2017 I worked full-time as a teacher while also studying full-time for a master’s degree. During this time I also managed a small team of teaching assistants. 
In order to make the work we all did was effective I took the long view of planning. At the start of the year, I considered the attainment profile of the children we would be teaching and prioritised certain areas of learning to make sure maximum progress would be achieved. Following this I considered the strengths and skills of the teaching assistants I would be working with and organised for them to lead targeted interventions with key children. I also mapped out key dates such as my coursework deadlines, report deadlines, and assessment weeks, to ensure all work was started and completed in good time.
As a result of my proactive approach my team members’ time was used effectively, my pupils made good progress, and I successfully completed my master’s degree.

Awareness of factors influencing poor attendance and disengagement with school and utilising existing policies and procedures to improve outcomes for learners
My master’s degree in education policy and practical experience of working in education give me a strong understanding of the factors which influence poor school attendance and engagement. As part of my master’s I studied the complex socio-economic factors which influence educational outcomes. 
In line with this I have seen how complex domestic situations affect children’s ability to engage with school. An example of this was when I noticed that one child in my class was regularly failing to attend school on Wednesdays. I talked to the child’s mother about the issue and discovered that, due to work commitments, she was unable to bring her child to school on Wednesday mornings and was leaving the child with her elderly grandmother, who was too frail to take the child to school. 
In order to support the family, I used my knowledge of the school community and discovered that one of the school’s teaching assistants lived near to the child who could not make it to school. I knew that the TA took attendance very seriously and would be willing to help so asked if she would be willing to pick up the child on her way to work on Wednesdays. The teaching assistant agreed. 
However, I was unsure if staff collecting children was permitted by the school’s policies, so checked the plan with the headteacher, she said that it was permitted with the express written consent of the parent. So I took the suggestion to the parent who was relieved that a solution to the problem had been found and gladly signed a form saying she was happy for the TA to take her child to school. 
As a result of my actions, the child was able to access school every day, the mother was relieved that a difficult situation had been positively resolved, and a new community connection was made between the child, her mother, and the helpful teaching assistant. 

Support and develop a culture of innovation within the team including the development of resources		
I have developed and supported a culture of innovation in previous teams. An example of this is while working as a teacher I noticed that a TA was keeping track of how many pages each child had read in the class and giving out stickers each time a child read 100 pages. I saw that the children found this highly motivating and it was promoting reading. I talked to the TA and shared that I thought this was an excellent idea, I suggested developing the idea buy making a class ‘reading leaderboard’ and buying some bigger rewards, such as badges, for greater numbers of pages. When the children responded well to this innovation, I passed it on to a more senior member of staff, who helped roll out the practice across the school. As a result of my promotion of innovative practice within my team resources were developed which supported reading across the school.

Ability to identify service improvements and implement them within the team
As a teacher, I always contributed to my schools’ annual School Development Plan, which is a detailed document which identifies short, medium, and long-term goals for school development and plans ways to realise those goals. 
During the 2017 annual review, it was identified that a long-term goal for the school was to improve the use of innovative teaching techniques. I volunteered to take a lead on this area of school development and during the 2016/17 school year led a project to promote innovative practice. 
I led the project by first writing an action plan identifying key actions and a source academic text from which to draw innovative teaching techniques. Following on from this I researched the innovative techniques and introduced them into my own practice. Finally I disseminated my findings by leading whole school training sessions and coaching key members of staff in order to ensure my project had a long-term effect.
As a result of my actions, at the following School Development Plan annual review the management felt that strong progress towards the target of using innovative teaching techniques had been met.

Develop and maintain multi-agency partnership working to meet the individual needs of learners
I have extensive experience of multi-agency partnership working to meet the individual needs of learners. As a teacher I would often work with children with individual learning needs. When I felt they needed external support, I would use my knowledge of local services and my contacts with external professionals to arrange suitable support. An example of this is when I taught a boy who was struggling to begin to write complete sentences. I initially sought support and suggestions from other teachers in my school, who suggested consulting with an Occupational Therapist. The OT agreed to observe the boy but concluded that his barrier to writing was cognitive rather than physical. Following this, I consulted with an educational psychologist who eventually diagnosed the boy with a form of dyslexia. This diagnosis allowed the boy to access specialist dyslexia support provided by the local authority. Due to my confidence in working with multiple agencies, and perseverance and determination to support the boy, his individual needs were met and he accessed a service that allowed him to make progress with his writing.  

Ability to make connections across the department and other services within the Local Authority to embed TRAC and therefore avoid duplication	
I have experience of making connections across a workplace and avoiding duplication. While working as a Year 3 teacher, I arranged a trip to Westminster Abbey. While talking with colleagues from Year 6 I learned that later in the year they also intended to visit a church, but were yet to arrange the details. To save resources I offered to merge our trips. The other team accepted, so I booked extra Westminster Abbey places for their children. My actions avoided duplication; the other team did not have to research an appropriate venue, visit the venue to assure suitability, or produce risk assessment documents because I had already completed those tasks. 

Ability to lead a team and to work effectively as part of a wider management team
I have lead a number of teaching teams over several years and have always worked to balance the needs of my team with the wider management needs of the organisation. An example of this was when an extra teaching assistant became available having returned from maternity leave. I pitched to the school’s leadership team that the TA should be deployed to my team due to the large number of children who needed extra support. When another teacher, who was in a similarly difficult situation, also requested the extra member of staff, I met with him and we arranged to share the extra member of staff as needed between our classes. We approached the wider management team with our solution to the situation and they were pleased to approve our plan and happy that we had effectively resolved the problem. By positively working with a member of another team I was able to balance the needs of my team with the needs of the wider organisation.

Ability to make an assessment and recommendations regarding intervention and support for learners and their families and provide staff with the necessary advice and support 
Whilst working in a deprived London school, I volunteered to lead a whole school project to promote interventions based on the use of Doug Lemov’s book Teach Like a Champion. 
I began by reading the literature surrounding the Teach Like a Champion and considering wider research which evaluated the different methods detailed. I reflected on my own practice and considered the needs of the learners across the school when considering how methods could best be applied – as the school I was working at had a high intake of children with special needs, it was important that I assessed the suitability of different methods carefully and was mindful of the time constraints within the classroom. Further to this, I also discussed the methods with other staff members – asking them about their experiences and about how they felt different methods could be used with different classes. 
Based on my research and discussions, I recommended a range of different teaching and class management methods from Teach Like a Champion, such as using minimal levels of intervention to reduce interruptions to learning. I led an INSET (training) session, and coached other teachers on some of the techniques that I found were most effective in the context that we were working in. The coaching sessions were particularly successful, with one teacher feeding back that the sessions ‘made a significant difference’ to her practice.

Evidence of the practical application of safeguarding and subsequent actions
I have experience of the practical application of safeguarding and subsequent actions. As a teacher a child disclosed to me that she had been hit by an adult who ran an informal after-school mosque club outside of school. I listened to what the child had to say, avoided leading questions, and ensured that it was clear to her that I while I would share what she had said with other appropriate adults I would do everything in my power to help her. Immediately following the conversation, I wrote down verbatim what she had said and immediately passed on the information to the school’s designated safeguarding lead, who called social services and eventually the police. As a result of the investigation by the school and the police the children involved were protected when the alleged gentleman who ran the after-school club agreed to close the club and cease running any further after-school activities. 

Advise the Project Manager of key issues and risks 	
I have experience of completing Project Management documents such as Risk Registers or Risk Assessments to ensure that those managing projects have a good understanding of the risks that may be faced during an activity or project.
As a teacher, when assisting in managing events such as school fairs, taking children on school trips, and when completing weekly activities such as taking the children swimming, I completed a range of documents to highlight key issues and risks. During the planning stage, of activities such as swimming lessons, I considered the issues and risks that could be faced; however, I also re-visited the risk register to add additional information after the first lesson had taken place. In school, I found that discussing the risks associated with activities with other members of staff, some of whom had previous experience, was always helpful in gaining understanding of the situations that might impact the activity.
I completed documents carefully, weighing and scoring different risks and considering how risks could be mitigated – for example, I recommended high-vis jackets to help ensure safety when walking to the local leisure centre. However, if there were risks that were particularly high, which I didn’t feel could be appropriately mitigated for, I raised these with my manager to ask for advice and support.	

Make service / resource efficiency recommendations to Project Manager
I have a good understanding of the principles of a Project Management and the need to produce documents such Business Cases in order to justify expenditure. Therefore, when working on projects I consider the balance between efficiency and effectiveness and look for areas that can be improved.
An example of this, was when I was asked by the Business Manager to plan a series of school trips for Key Stage 2 children. I spent time analysing the National Curriculum, researching appropriate trips, and procuring quotes so that I could consider which trips offered the children and the school most value. I carefully considered both monetary and educational value and looked for discounts and funding to support the trips. Based on my research, I made a series of recommendations to the Business Manager – explaining how I had costed and considered each option to reach a decision.
Based on my recommendations, the Business Manager applied for Transport for London (TfL) Educational Transport Funding, which enabled all Key Stage 2 children to travel on the London Underground for free. As the trips I had planned were all linked to the National Curriculum, we were able to benefit from free transport when visiting famous historical landmarks such as Westminster Abbey.

Ability to plan team resources effectively to meet needs of the caseload	
I have extensive experience of planning to meet a heavy workload. I always plan my team’s resources based on individual member’s strengths and always ensure to leave as much headroom for unexpected events as possible. As a result of my effective long-term planning I always ensure work is completed to a high standard. 

Ability to respond appropriately in a crisis situation	
Working as a teacher I encountered a number of stressful situations in which I remained calm and tackled the cause of the problem. One such example is when a child in my class who had severe behavioural problems became agitated and started displaying dangerous behaviour, such as throwing chairs. Firstly, I remained calm, and ensured the safety of the rest of the class by asking a teaching assistant to escort them to the class next door. Once the rest of the class were safe, I spent time sitting and talking to the upset child and was able to calm him down to the point that he was able to safely walk to an assistant headteacher’s office and complete his work there. As a result of this calm approach everybody remained safe, and the agitated child was moved to a calm location until he was ready to return to class.	

Ability to travel across and beyond the County to fulfil work demands 	
I have a valid driver's licence and enjoy travelling through the North Wales counties in my current position as a supply teacher.

Personal strategies for working within a demanding work setting	
I have worked in a number of demanding work settings and have developed a broad range of personal strategies to cope. These include always focusing on the bigger picture and the positive mission of the organisation, using my free time to destress effectively, for example by walking in the mountains, and developing strong networks of professional colleagues to provide advice and support.

Qualifications, Experience and Professional Development 	
In 2014 I gained Qualified Teacher Status after completing a PGCE at Wolverhampton University. In the three years since then I have successfully taught in years 3 and 4 at Harry Gosling Primary School in Tower Hamlets, East London. In addition to successfully teaching three classes across two year and phase groups, I made a number of other achievements during my time at Harry Gosling. These included completing a master’s degree in Education Policy from the UCL Institute of Education, mentoring a student teacher, and leading a whole school project focusing on integrating Doug Lemov’s Teach Like a Champion project into school practice.

Leadership and management experience:
I have experience of successfully leading, planning, managing, and evaluating change which has had a significant impact at whole school level. During the 2016/17 school year, I lead a project focusing on implementing the recommendations of the book Teach Like a Champion into school practice. 
At the start of the project I met with the headteacher, who outlined her expectations of the project and what she hoped could be achieved by the project, following this I wrote an action plan outlining, in specific and measurable terms, how I intended to promote Teach Like a Champion across the school. For example, one the key objectives outlined in the action plan was for a small number of teacher to have in depth knowledge of Teach Like a Champion, so that they could pass on knowledge and skills to other colleagues. I achieved this objective through a series of coaching sessions with two other class teachers who volunteered to take part in the project. Both teachers found the project highly rewarding and feedback that their practice had developed as a result. Additionally, whole school knowledge of Teach Like a Champion was promoted through a CDP session and ‘tweaks of the week’. By the end of the year whole school consciousness and use of the techniques found in Teach Like a Champion had greatly developed. 
I have not directly lead a subject, however in my previous school each member of staff was part of a ‘curriculum team’ which supported a subject leader and assisted with activities such as writing action plans. Further to this, I have successfully worked with a number of education partners and providers including; the local authority, arts charities, businesses, and other public organisations such as the British Museum. 

Setting high expectations which motivate and challenge
I always set high expectations which motivate and challenge my pupils. High expectations, whether they are around behaviour, presentation, or quality of work are intrinsic to quality teaching. I always aim to model my high expectations, for example through shared writing and also to reward children who meet my expectations through positive praise. 

Ensuring good progress and outcomes by pupils.
I work hard to ensure good progress and outcomes by pupils. One important way to achieve this is through regular communication with parents, in my last role I set up weekly meeting with the parent of one child who was in danger of making limited progress, this made a huge impact on the child who made good progress by the end of the year.

Planning well-structured and exciting lessons
I plan well structured and exciting lessons which have a clear focus. One example of this is when learning about Italy in Year 3 I led a lesson in which children made pizza from scratch. This was a fun and exciting task however it had a clear learning focus – to understand the process of making pizza, and also a clear structure in which I modelled making the dough before the children.

Adapting teaching to respond to the strengths and needs of the pupils.
I am highly adept at responding to the strength and needs of pupils. My approach to differentiation is to look beyond simply adjusting the task to make it more or less difficult for pupils, and instead trying to identify opportunities for further challenge or barriers to learning that individuals or groups may be facing. For example, a common issue faced by lower attaining children is that a lesson requires too much information be memorised in order to access the task; for instance, the need to memorise a number of historical dates in order to produce a piece of history writing. In cases such as this a resource such as a prompt sheet may be enough to reduce cognitive load and allow a child to access the same learning as other members of the class. 

Making accurate and effective use of assessment 
Assessment is vital to ensuring good teaching. I use a range of formative assessment techniques in my teaching, such as questioning or whiteboard tasks, this allows to tweaks to be made during lessons. However, I also use assessment to inform my planning. For example, tweaking plans after marking books.

Professional Experience, Knowledge and Understanding
I am able to plan effective lessons with a thematic approach. Joined up thematic teaching is an important part of my planning. For example, I planned and taught a Year 3 unit on the Stone Age which included English work producing Stone Age diaries after reading ‘Stone Age Boy’ by Satoshi Kitamura and history work which culminated in producing non-chronological reports which were informed by computing work involving using the site DK Findout to research the Stone Age. In addition to this, I arranged a trip to the British Museum to see Stone Age artifacts in real life and worked with the local authority library service to ensure we had enough Stone Age themed books to further inspire children.
I have experience of using a range of teaching styles to meet the needs of pupils. During my time at Harry Gosling I received CPD on a number of teaching styles. This included Singapore style maths lessons, which focus heavily on using worded problems to stretch the most able and physical and visual resources to support lower attainers. In addition I also received extensive training on Pie Corbett’s Talk for Writing approach to English lessons which promotes a visual approach to story planning and extensive oral rehearsal of sentence level work.
I have a strong commitment to continued professional development of myself and others. Over the last two years I have completed an MA in Education Policy at the UCL Institute of Education. The after-school university sessions and extra weekend work demonstrate my commitment to my own development. Further to this I am also happy to help others in their CPD, for example through the Teach Like a Champion coaching I have already outlined and my time mentoring a PGCE student who has now gone on to be a successful practitioner. 

Personal Skills and Attributes
I have excellent interpersonal skills and enjoy forming and working in strong teams. On my last day at my previous school one of the TAs who had worked in my year group spoke in front of the whole school staff and thanked my for encouraging and helping her apply to a PGCE course. This was a very proud moment and I feel is indicative of my passionate, caring, and honest approach to working with others. Further to this I take professionalism highly seriously and always strive to be as consistent, reliable and fair as possible. In order to develop my teaching I am open and reflective, I am always happy to talk with others about my practice. My self-motivation means I always challenge and push myself to achieve more. However, I hope, I retain a strong sense of humour!

Qualified to degree level or equivalent proven working experience.
I have a range of academic qualifications that are relevant to this role and compliment my professional experience. I have a BA(hons) in Politics from Lancaster University, a PGCE in Primary Education from Wolverhampton University, and a MA in Education Policy from University College London, which is rated as the number one university in the world for education studies. 

Full working knowledge of relevant polices/codes of practice/legislation
I have good knowledge of a range of education policy as a result of completing an MA in Education Policy; as part of my course I studied a range of policies and their implications for practice.
Further to my academic understanding, I have received extensive child protection training, for example regarding the Children’s Act’s (2004) requirement for close interdisciplinary cooperation. I note the importance of the Social Care and Wellbeing Act (Wales) (2014)’s provision that education is an important part of a person’s wellbeing. Additionally, I have experience of helping parents fulfil their requirement to ensure their children receive a suitable education under the 1996 Education Act, for example by helping arrange appropriate transport to and from school. 
I also feel that acts such as the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 and the 2010 Equality Act, will be vitally important to this role. I understand the importance of ensuring that those with protected characteristics are able to access high-quality education, and strive to consider the impact of my decisions in the context of Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act. 

Knowledge of Safeguarding
I have experience of the practical application of safeguarding and subsequent actions. As a teacher a child disclosed to me that she had been hit by an adult who ran an informal after-school mosque club outside of school. I listened to what the child had to say, avoided leading questions, and ensured that it was clear to her that I while I would share what she had said with other appropriate adults I would do everything in my power to help her. Immediately following the conversation, I wrote down verbatim what she had said and immediately passed on the information to the school’s designated safeguarding lead, who called social services and eventually the police. As a result of the investigation by the school and the police the children involved were protected when the alleged gentleman who ran the after-school club agreed to close the club and cease running any further after-school activities. 

Ability to use standard software packages for example Outlook, Word and Excel
I have an extremely high level of digital literacy, and this is something that I have developed professionally and in my spare time. I am confident using Microsoft Packages such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint to communicate and display information, and in my spare time I have developed smartphone apps and websites.
I enjoy all manner of computing projects and have often found ways to utilise my skills within the workplace. Colleagues often ask for my support with IT issues and I am always more than happy to help, for example, I recently worked at Ysgol Eirias and was asked to troubleshoot an issue with a projector – I was able to diagnose the problem and change the bulb within minutes to ensure the lesson could continue. 

Skilled in terms of time management and task prioritisation
I have highly developed time management and prioritisation skills. An example of this is from when between 2015 and 2017 I worked full-time as a teacher while also studying full-time for a master’s degree. During this time I also managed a small team of teaching assistants. 
In order to make the work we all did was effective I took the long view of planning. At the start of the year, I considered the attainment profile of the children we would be teaching and prioritised certain areas of learning to make sure maximum progress would be achieved. Following this I considered the strengths and skills of the teaching assistants I would be working with and organised for them to lead targeted interventions with key children. I also mapped out key dates such as my coursework deadlines, report deadlines, and assessment weeks, to ensure all work was started and completed in good time.
As a result of my proactive approach my team members’ time was used effectively, my pupils made good progress, and I successfully completed my master’s degree.

Ability to process complex information, produce data/information and deliver this information to the appropriate audience.
I have extensive experience of extracting and analysing data, gained from both academic study and professional experience. 
As part of both my BA and MA programmes I studies quantitative research methods and used statistical software programs such as STATA and SPSS to analyse data. I also have experience of applying this skill professionally, for example as a teacher I analysed data to identify groups of children who had made lower than expected progress. I was able to record information regarding their educational and personal development using PIVOT tables in Microsoft excel and specialist software, before plotting this data and displaying it graphically to enhance my understanding the degree to which progress had been made and targets met. Plotting the data carefully allowed me to identify those who fell outside of the standard deviation expected; I was able to contextualise this information based on my relationship with each child and develop interventions to support them in making progress. 

Ability to shape internal processes in response to identified needs
As a teacher, I always contributed to my schools’ annual School Development Plan, which is a detailed document which identifies short, medium, and long-term goals for school development and plans ways to realise those goals. 
During the 2016 annual review, it was identified that a long-term goal for the school was to improve the use of innovative teaching techniques. I volunteered to take a lead on this area of school development and during the 2016/17 school year led a project to promote innovative practice. 
I led the project by first writing an action plan identifying key actions and a source academic text from which to draw innovative teaching techniques. Following on from this I researched the innovative techniques and introduced them into my own practice. Finally I disseminated my findings by leading whole school training sessions and coaching key members of staff in order to ensure my project had a long-term effect.
As a result of my actions, at the following School Development Plan annual review the management felt that strong progress towards the target of using innovative teaching techniques had been met.

Ability to manage positive relationships with partner/external organisations effectively e.g. Welsh Government, Regional consortia, Estyn
I have experience of making positive contributions to professional multidisciplinary panels, and understand the importance of applying a whole-system approach to support service users.
As a teacher I regularly attended the annual reviews of children with statemented special educational needs. Reviews would be attended by a range of other professionals and interested parties from different organisations - such as social workers, educational psychologists, parents, other teachers, or speech and language therapists. An example of a time I made a positive contribution to such a meeting was when, as the teacher of a seven year old autistic child, I worked alongside an educational psychologist and other professionals to develop a plan to explain to the child that she was autistic, and what autism was. My contributions, such as identifying language and concepts that the child would be able to understand, and my willingness to engage with other partners so that I could benefit from their expertise, facilitated the successful development and implementation of the plan. Over a period of several months, I was able to implement the plan and help the child understand what autism meant to them.

Willing to work outside normal hours when necessary and to be flexible in approach to all duties
I have a highly flexible approach to work and realise that sometimes work needs to be done irregularly. An example of this is my current work as a supply teacher, which requires a flexible approach, for example being called in with short notice.

Ability to travel across and beyond the County to fulfil work demands
I have a valid driver’s licence and enjoy travelling through the North Wales counties in my current position as a supply teacher.

Relevant degree 
I have a range of academic qualifications that are relevant to this role and compliment my professional experience. I have a BA(hons) in Politics from Lancaster University, a PGCE in Primary Education from Wolverhampton University, and a MA in Education Policy from University College London, which is rated as the number one university in the world for education studies. 

Experience of working with disaffected / vulnerable young people.
I have considerable experience of working with disaffected and vulnerable young people. Prior to becoming a qualified teacher, I was a project worker at a supported housing unit for homeless 16-24 year olds. The supported housing unit was situated within a deprived area, and my role focussed on supporting the residents into education, training, or employment in addition to helping them become more independent. I enjoyed working with the young people I supported to understand the complexities that they faced in their everyday lives, and working with other agencies such as schools, colleges, or employers to overcome the barriers that they struggled with. I took an honest, compassionate, and user-centred approach to ensure that those I was supporting were claiming the correct benefits, able to access appropriate training, and able to secure suitable employment.
In addition to this, I also have experience of working as a teacher in a challenging inner-London primary school where many pupils faced extensive barriers to learning including: homelessness, domestic abuse, learning disabilities, and learning to speak English as an additional language. As a result, many children displayed behavioural difficulties and it took time to build trust and understanding so that I could consider how best to help them during their time at school. I relished the challenge of creating a safe, stimulating environment in school which my pupils could develop and learn despite whatever was happening outside of school. However, I also strove to work with other teachers, families, and the local authority to help pupils in their wider lives outside of the classroom. 

Experience of leading a team	
I have experience of leading small teams, and as a class teacher I lead teaching assistants, student teachers, junior teachers, and of course many pupils. 
While working in London and teaching a particularly challenging class, where four students had statements of educational need and a further five pupils were on the school’s special educational needs register, I lead a team of four teaching assistants and a student teacher. Even with such a large teaching team the class remained challenging, so I ensured that my team worked as effectively as possible. I achieved this by clearly modelling my expectations; always remaining calm and focussed on the task at hand. I also listened closely to what all members of staff had to say and acted quickly on their concerns, for example calling parents whenever there were worries about the welfare of a child. Additionally, I also worked hard to ensure that staff moral remained high by celebrating the good work that the team was doing and pointing out all of the great progress our pupils were making.
By the end of the year we were a tight knit team who had helped all members of our class make good academic and personal progress, despite the challenges we had faced along the way.

Specialist skills and experience (eg supporting young people with substance misuse/ mental health /Autistic Spectrum Disorders) 
I have experience of working with young people with substance misuse problems, mental health problems, and those on the Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
I have substantial experience of working with young people with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. I have taught many pupils diagnosed with ASD in a mainstream educational setting and have helped them overcome challenges associated with their condition. For example, I have experience of helping a child transition from mainstream to special education. The process began by supporting the child’s parents and advising them around the appropriateness of specialist education for their son, and discussing school options. Following the decision to transfer to a special school, I worked with the new school, for example by arranging transfer days, where the boy visited his new school and became comfortable in the new setting. In addition to this, I also have experience of teaching autistic children in special school settings, for example at Ysgol Y Gogarth in Llandudno.
I also have experience of supporting people with mental health problems. For example, working as a teacher one of my pupils was suffering from mental health issues following the death of his mother. To help him I spoke to his father and suggested a referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAHMS). While the father was initially reluctant to go ahead with the referral due to community stigma surrounding mental health issues, due to the positive relationship I had developed with him and his son, he eventually agreed, and his son was able to access the help he needed. I applied a similar approach, when working as a project worker – where many of the young homeless people I supported had substance misuse issues - I supported them by working with them to build trust and understanding before directing them to appropriate local support groups and resources and taking a proactive approach to ensuring they were able to access these resources. 

Experience of working in partnership with other agencies and contributing to professionals’ meetings and multidisciplinary panels
I have experience of making positive contributions to professional multidisciplinary panels, and understand the importance of applying a whole-system approach to support service users.
As a teacher I regularly attended the annual reviews of children with statemented special educational needs. Reviews would be attended by a range of other professionals and interested parties from different organisations - such as social workers, educational psychologists, parents, other teachers, or speech and language therapists.

Over a period of several months, I was able to implement the plan and help the child understand what autism meant to them. 

Working knowledge of the Children’s Act 1989/2004 and the Social Care and Wellbeing Act 2014 and other relevant Education Acts relating to Attendance and Inclusion
I have good knowledge of a range of education policy as a result of completing an MA in Education Policy; as part of my course I studied a range of policies and their implications for practice.
Further to my academic understanding, I have received extensive child protection training, for example regarding the Children’s Act’s (2004) requirement for close interdisciplinary cooperation. I note the importance of the Social Care and Wellbeing Act (Wales) (2014)’s provision that education is an important part of a person’s wellbeing. Additionally, I have experience of helping parents fulfil their requirement to ensure their children receive a suitable education under the 1996 Education Act, for example by helping arrange appropriate transport to and from school. 
I also feel that acts such as the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 and the 2010 Equality Act, will be vitally important to this role. I understand the importance of ensuring that those with protected characteristics are able to access high-quality education, and strive to consider the impact of my decisions in the context of Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act. 

Experience of working on European Projects and the requirements of detailed record keeping
I have experience of working on European Projects and understand the need to record appropriate data. For example, while working as a teacher in London, my school received an EU grant designed to improve foreign language provision. As part of the project we were required to keep detailed assessment data around our pupils’ attainment in French. I recorded the data accurately and reliably in order to ensure accountability; in addition to ensuring that detailed records were kept for the purpose of the funding, I enjoyed evaluating the data at the end of the project as it showed how much progress the children had made and demonstrated that we had made good use of the funding.

Ability to extract and analyse data in order to identify trends to ensure that the operation meets its targets	
I have extensive experience of extracting and analysing data, gained from both academic study and professional experience. 
As part of both my BA and MA programmes I studies quantitative research methods and used statistical software programs such as STATA and SPSS to analyse data.
